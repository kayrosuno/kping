# Artifact Hub repository metadata file
#
# Some settings like the verified publisher flag or the ignored packages won't
# be applied until the next time the repository is processed. Please keep in
# mind that the repository won't be processed if it has not changed since the
# last time it was processed. Depending on the repository kind, this is checked
# in a different way. For Helm http based repositories, we consider it has
# changed if the `index.yaml` file changes. For git based repositories, it does
# when the hash of the last commit in the branch you set up changes. This does
# NOT apply to ownership claim operations, which are processed immediately.
